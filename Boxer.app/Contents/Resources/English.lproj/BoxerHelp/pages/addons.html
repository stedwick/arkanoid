		<h1>Installing a game expansion or add-on</h1>
		
		<p>Some MS-DOS games received official expansion packs: these usually came on their own diskettes or CD-ROMs and require separate installation. To install an expansion:</p>
			
		<ol class="steps">
			<li><strong>Launch the original game and then quit back to DOS.</strong> Leave the window open at the DOS prompt.</li>
			
			<li><ul class="unbulleted">
				<li><strong>If the expansion is on a physical CD,</strong> insert the CD into your Mac’s DVD drive.</li>
				<li><strong>If the expansion is on a disc image,</strong> double-click the disc image to mount it as an OS X volume.</li>
			</ul></li>
			
			<li>Browse the expansion’s files in Finder to <strong>locate the installer program for the expansion</strong>: usually “<span class="filename">INSTALL.EXE</span>”, “<span class="filename">SETUP.EXE</span>” or similar.</li>

			<li><p><strong>Drag the expansion’s installer program into the DOS window to launch it.</strong> Follow the installer’s instructions to complete the installation.</p>
				<p class="tip"><strong>If the installer asks for the location of the original game</strong>, enter the path on drive C in which the original game was installed: e.g. “<span class="filepath">C:\GAMENAME</span>”. If you’re not sure, <strong>choose the installer’s default location</strong> if it has one, or <a href="gameboxes.html#gameboxes-exploring" rel="topic">browse the gamebox in Finder</a> to locate the game’s folder.</p></li>

			<li>
				<p><strong>If the expansion came on a physical CD or disc image</strong>, it may have copy protection that requires the expansion CD to be present while playing. If so, <a href="swapping-cds.html#swapping-bundled-cds" rel="topic">import the expansion CD into the gamebox</a> after installation.</p>
				<p class="tip">While playing, you can use <span class="menu">Drives ▸ Next Disc</span> to switch from the original CD (if any) to the expansion CD.</p>
			</li>
		</ol>
