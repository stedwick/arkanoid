MAIN GAME SCREEN

	These instructions introduce you to the features of this playable demo of ORIGIN's ULTIMA Underworld.

3-D View Window
	The view window at the top-center of the screen shows what you see in the Abyss as you move, the view changes to reflect your new position. When you take damage in combat, the window shakes. Normally, you look straight ahead, but you can look up and down: To look down, press <1> repeatedly.  To look up, press <3> repeatedly. To return to the "straight ahead" position, press <2>.
 
Character Panel
	Three panels share this position, to the right of the view window. The inventory panel shows items you are carrying and wearing. Click on the pull chain to flip to the statistics panel. This displays detailed information about your character's skills and current condition. Click on the pull chain to return to the inventory panel. When you get a runebag, left-click it in your inventory to flip to the rune display. This shows the runes you own. Click on the pull chain to return to the inventory panel. On these panels, the right mouse-button triggers the action specified by the command icon selected; the left button selects, moves or uses an object.
 
Vitality and Mana Flasks
	These flasks, below the character panel, show your state of health (the red flask) and your level of magical energy (the blue flask). If the red flask is green, you are poisoned.

Power Gem
	In combat, keep your eye on the gem just above the message scroll on the left side of the screen. This glows red, then yellow, then green, then sparkles as you put more power into an attack.

Command Icons
	These icons, above the power gem on the left side of the view window, access the game option panel, and determine what the right mouse-button does. The command icons are:
	Options Icon. Click on this to bring up a list of game-related functions and to pause the game. Click on the function you wish to access:
		* Save Game. Disabled in demo.
		* Restore Game. Disabled in demo.
		* Music. Toggles music on or off.
		* Sound. Toggles sound effects on or off.
		* Detail. Increases or decreases the level of graphic detail.
		* Return to Game. Resumes play when you're done selecting options.
		* Quit Game. Returns you to DOS.
	Talk Icon. Left-click this icon, then right-click the character you want to talk to. Select conversation options as they appear on the message scroll at the bottom of the screen. To select an option, click on it with your mouse or press the number key that matches the number of the statement you wish to make.
	Get Icon. Left-click this icon, then right-click an object  to pick it up. Click again to drop the object wherever you want, either in your inventory or in the view window.
	Look Icon. Left-click this icon, then right-click the object or area you want to look at. A description appears on the message scroll.
	Fight Icon. Left-click this icon. To attack, right-click and hold until you're ready to attack, then release the right button (see Combat, below).
	Use Icon. Left-click this icon, then right-click the object you want to use. This works for pull chains, food, and many other items. For actions that require a target (keys on doors, for example), left-click the Use icon, then right-click the object you wish to use (putting it "in-hand"). Move the object in-hand over the "target" object and right-click again.

Default Mode
	If no icons are highlighted, you are in Default Mode. (To "un-highlight" an icon, click on it.)
	Talk. Put the cursor on the person or creature and briefly right-drag the mouse.
	Get. Position the cursor on the object, press and hold the right mouse-button. If the object is "get-able," it will be put in-hand when you drag it where you want. Release the button to drop the item.
	Look. Right-click on the creature or item you want to examine.
	Fight. Move the cursor to your inventory and click on the weapon in your weapon-hand. Click on the weapon again to exit fight mode.
	Use. To use an object in your inventory, left-click it. To use an object in the view window, position the cursor on the object, and briefly right-drag it.
	Note: To access the game options menu you must click on the Options icon or press the appropriate keys on the keyboard.
 

MOVEMENT

	Press and hold the left mouse-button while the cursor is in the 3-D view window. The further from the center of the window your cursor is, the faster you move. The shape of the cursor determines direction:
	<Up-arrow>: Move forward
	<Right-arrow> or <left-arrow>: Turn right or left while moving forward
	<Sharp-right-arrow> of <sharp-left-arrow>: Turn right or left with no forward movement
	<Horizontal right-arrow> or <horizontal-left arrow>: Sidestep right or left
	<Down-arrow>: Move backwards
	To jump, press the right mouse-button while the left button is down. Your speed determines how far you jump: Standing still, you jump straight up. Walking or running, you jump in the direction of your movement; distance jumped increases with speed.
 

MAGIC

	To cast a spell, get the blue and gold runebag (it's in a backpack) and drag into it any magical blue and gold runes you find as you explore. Click on the runebag in your inventory to flip to the rune panel, then click on each rune required to cast the spell, in order. (To identify each rune stone, use the Look command, described above.) When the runes appear on the rune shelf, to the left of the two Vitality and Mana flasks, left-click anywhere on the rune shelf. The spells you can cast in this demo are:
		Create Food     (Required runes: In Mani Ylem)
		Light           (Required runes: In Lor)
		Magic Arrow     (Required runes: Ort Jux)
		Resist Blows    (Required runes: Bet In Sanct)
	The Magic Arrow spell must be targeted. When you left-click the rune shelf to cast this spell, a red circle appears. This is the targeting cursor. Position the cursor on the person, creature or object you wish to target, then right-click to unleash the spell. (You may or may not succeed.)
 

COMBAT

 Using a Hand Weapon.
	Click on a weapon in your weapon hand (or on the Fight icon) to enter fight mode. Position the arrow cursor on your target. Hold down the right button until the weapon is drawn back (You can continue to move by pressing the left button while the right button is pressed.) To bash, press the right button when the cursor is high in the view window; to slash, press the right button when the cursor is in the middle of the view window, to thrust, press the right button when the cursor is low in the view window. With the weapon drawn back, the power gem begins to brighten, indicating how much power you are putting into the attack. Release the mouse-button to attack. (If the gem is still red when you release the button, your attack is aborted.)
 

 CONVERSATION

	Click on the Talk icon. Position the cursor over the character you wish to talk to, then press the right mouse-button to bring up the conversation screen. The other person's comments appear on the large scroll in the center of the screen. Your response options appear on your message scroll. Move the yellow cross onto the option you want and click either button (or press the number of the statement you want to make). Read the other person's response and pick one of your own. If you see the word "[MORE]" at the end of a comment, click either mouse-button or press any key to see the rest of what the other person has to say. If you see the word "Other" in your list of choices, you have the option of typing in something that isn't on your list. If you have the last word in the conversation, you return to the main game screen automatically. Otherwise, click either mouse-button or press any key.
