Epic Pinball    *    Instructions & Troubleshooting Info     *    Version 2.1
=============================================================================

SPECIAL EPIC PINBALL UPDATE:

This is version 2.1 of Epic Pinball.  It fixes several problems with
"almost" Sound Blaster compatible sound cards, such as the Sound Galaxy,
Multimedia Pro 16, and Packard Bell sound card.

=============================================================================

Epic Pinball Requires:
  * A 386 or faster IBM-compatible PC
  * VGA graphics
  * Hard disk

Also supports:
  * Sound Blaster, SB Pro, and compatible music cards
  * Gravis Ultrasound music card

To start Epic Pinball:

1. Switch to the drive where the game is installed (C:)
2. Switch to the subdirectory where the game is installed (CD \PINBALL)
3. Type PINBALL.


=============================================================================
		      Common problems and solutions
=============================================================================

Running with WINDOWS
====================

To run this game under Windows,  be sure to run the file "PINBALL.PIF" (not
the file "PINBALL.EXE").  This should would very reliably under Windows on
nearly all computers.

If you encounter any problems running through Windows, please exit and run
Epic Pinball through plain DOS instead.  We appologize for the inconvenience.
Making Epic games work through Windows is a top priority for us,  and we're
working to improve our Windows compatibility.

Running with OS/2
=================

Though Epic Pinball will work reliably under OS/2 on some computers, we
don't recommend this because it might result in the game locking up.
Please run Epic Pinball through DOS or Windows instead.  We tried to make
this game compatible with OS/2,  but alas we were not successful.


NOT ENOUGH FREE MEMORY
======================

Problem:  When I run Epic Pinball,  the game refuses to start and gives
   me the message "You need (amount) of free memory to run this program".

Solution:  You need to free up more main (conventional) memory before
   starting Epic Pinball.  Here are some solution tips:

1. If you are trying to run Epic Pinball from Windows, completely exit
   Windows and try running it from DOS.

2. If you are trying to run Epic Pinball from "DOSSHELL" or any other
   menu program,  please exit from the menu program.  Then, run Epic Pinball
   from the DOS prompt.  Menu programs often occupy enough memory that
   there won't be enough left for Epic Pinball.

If neither #1 or #2 solves the problem,  do the following:

1. From the DOS prompt,  type "MEM" and press Enter.

2. You'll see a lot of information about your computer's memory.  Look at
   the number after the words "Largest Executable Program Size".  This is
   how much memory you currently have available.

Now you need to free up more main memory.  Here are some tips:

1. If you're using DOS 6.0 or later,  reboot your computer by pressing
   RESET or Ctrl-Alt-Del.  Wait for the message "Starting MS-DOS..." to come
   up.  Now press the [F5] key.

   This will cause DOS 6.0 to bypass all of your TSR's, memory managers,
   and other programs which normally occupy main memory.

   Now change into the Pinball directory and begin the game.

2. If you have a version of DOS earlier than 6.0:  You need to create a
   "boot disk" to allow you to start your computer without loading all
   the TSR's and memory managers that take away main memory.  Here's how.

   A. Put a blank disk in your A: drive and format it as a DOS disk.  (Don't
      do this in your B: drive - it won't work!)  To do this, type the
      following command:
      
      FORMAT A: /S

   B.  Wait while your computer formats the disk.
   C.  Label the disk "Boot Disk" and keep it handy.  You'll need this
       disk whenever you want to start Epic Pinball.

   Now, you can reboot your computer and play Epic Pinball:

   A.  Put the boot disk in your A: drive.
   B.  Restart your computer,  either by pressing CTRL-ALT-DELETE,  by
       hitting your reset button,  or by turning it on.
   C.  Wait while your computer boots from the boot disk.
   D.  After a little while, your computer will stop and give you the A>
       prompt.
   E. Now change to your hard disk by typing "C:".
   F. Go into the pinball directory by typing "CD \PINBALL".
   G. Begin by typing "PINBALL".

   Note to owners of "Stacker", "Superstor", and other hard disk compression
   programs:  If your C: drive is compressed and you need a boot disk to
   start Epic Pinball, you must install Pinball on a different,
   non-compressed drive.  See your Stacker or Superstor manual for
   instructions on doing this.  (This only applies to users of DOS
   version 5.0 or earlier).


GENERAL PROBLEMS
================

Problem: When I run PINBALL,  the computer locks up or reboots.

Solution:  Run SETUP and verify that your settings are correct.  If you are
   not using a sound card, make sure that SETUP is set for "No Sound Card".
   If you are using a sound card, verify that:

1. The correct options are specified in SETUP.  Check your address, IRQ,
   and DMA settings (most sound cards operate on DMA 1).  If you don't know
   your card's address, IRQ, and DMA settings, consult your sound card
   manual for details on figuring them out.  If your sound quality is set
   to "Ultra High Quality" or "Very High Quality", try setting it to
   just "High Quality".

2. Your sound card has no address, IRQ, or DMA conflicts with other cards
   in your system!  If your sound card works properly with other games, you
   can assume that there are no conflicts.  However, if your sound card does
   not work with other games,  you have a conflict.  See your sound card
   manual for details on resolving these conflicts.


Problem: The music is too loud (or too quiet).

Solution: From the main menu in Pinball, go into "Configuration".  There's
   a volume control there!  This wasn't present in version 2.0, but we
   added due to its high demand.


Problem: I notice a bit of flicker in the dotmation (dot animation).

Solution:  This will happen on slower computers (386, less than 33 mhz) when
   you have the music playing through your Sound Blaster.  If you find this
   distracting,  we recommend turning off the music.


Problem: The music and sound effects sound OK when I start Epic Pinball, but
   they get cut off several seconds after a song begins.

Solution: This is what happens when you select the wrong IRQ for your sound
   card!  Run SETUP again and pick the correct IRQ.


Problem: My pinball game automatically gets put on "Pause" and does not 
   respond or the screen just goes blank.

Solution: Some powersaving utilities and screen savers conflict with Epic
   Pinball.  Disable any of these features before starting pinball or boot
   clean to avoid loading them into memory.


OTHER SOUND CARD NOTES
======================

Pro Audio Spectrum:

   Epic Pinball should work fine with the PAS, PAS+, and PAS-16 sound cards.
   You need to run SETUP and tell it that you have a Sound Blaster card (not
   a Sound Blaster Pro).

   Important!  To run Epic Pinball on any Pro Audio Spectrum sound card, you
   need to have the PAS drivers loaded properly.  Epic Pinball will only
   recognize your PAS card if the drivers are loaded.  See your PAS manual
   for instructions on loading the right PAS drivers in your AUTOEXEC.BAT
   and CONFIG.SYS files.

Gravis Ultrasound:

   By popular request, Epic Pinball supports the GUS!  Just specify Gravis
   Ultrasound from within SETUP.  If you have any problems, check your
   address, IRQ, and DMA settings.  If you still have problems, boot clean
   and try running Epic Pinball without any GUS drivers loaded - these
   drivers (such as SBOS) might perhaps interfere with the game's direct,
   native GUS support.

Other sound cards:

   Since new models of sound cards are always being manufactured and revised,
   here's how to contact the top sound card makers for information about
   sound card problems and obtaining the latest driver files.

   Note: Epic Pinball requires either a Gravis UltraSound or a genuine Sound
   Blaster card.  If your sound card isn't 100% compatible with the Sound
   Blaster, unfortunately it's not going to work with Epic Pinball.


   Here are some sound cards that usually do not work with Epic Pinball:
	
	- Ensoniq Soundscape
	- Reveal Wave 32

   We are currently looking into making Epic Pinball compatible with these 
   sound cards.
