------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What's a beta-version?
----------------------
Well, it's a version of a game that the people making the game 
releases to give people an idea of what the game will be like. 
It can also be sent to big companies who publish software.
If they like it they might publish it, and it will be able to buy it
in software stores and so on.
That's of course our goal, to get it published.

Speed - System requirements
---------------------------

When we started making Mobile Rage, we wanted to make a really FAST game.
Mobile Rage was supposed to run ok. on a 486:a...But as we went along,
the game become slower and slower... (so much for particles with shadow)

The Setting 
-----------

The setting is pretty unimportant in this beta version, the clans are
still under construction. Anyway, here it is :

   Mobile Rage is set in the future. There's
   been a huge nuclear war (World War
   III) that completely ruined
   everything...almost. Some people
   survived the war though, and lot's of
   them live in clans. That gives them a
   bigger chance to protect their territory,
   property and resources against other
   clans, and outlaws. Wars between the
   clans are quite common, but sometimes
   it's better to solve conflicts in a peaceful
   way. A peaceful way nowadays means
   a duel, and we're not talking about no gunfights
   here. No no, we're talking about racing!
   Racing with heavily armed cars. Almost
   all clans have their own champion, a
   highly respected roadwarrior who has
   won lot's of duels through the years.
   Money has no value these days. Why
   would you want a piece of metal or
   paper? You can't eat it. You can't run a
   car on it. It's useless. If you need a new
   machinegun you trade it against...well,
   maybe a carburettor and some barrels of gas.
